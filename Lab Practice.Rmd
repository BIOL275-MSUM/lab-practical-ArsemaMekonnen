```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## GitHub Documents

This project is mosquito counts in mean and standard error in three counties.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r mosq_count}
summary(mosq_count)
 ggplot(data = mosquito) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = mosq_count))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r temp, echo=FALSE}
plot(temp)
ggplot(data = mosquito) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = mosq_count), binwidth = 0.5)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
